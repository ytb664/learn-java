# Java Learning Progress
This is a repository to save my Java learning progress.

I learn Java from a course on Udemy, made by Tim Buchalka on which his Java course is among the top Java course with the most student and reviewer in Udemy.

I am a Student in a university, majoring in Management, Bachelor of Economics, but planning and dreaming on making my own start-ups in the future with my friend who is a Computer Science student in the same university as me.
